    <p>The Aeropress 'plunges' and forces water through the coffee to 
        extract the oils and flavour. In the airtight chamber of the Aeropress 
        air is compressed and pressure exerted on the coffee liquid can be used 
        to help highlight your favourite coffee flavours. While this pressure won't 
        ever equal that of a commercial espresso machine you are able to create a 
        cup of coffee with more body and bolder taste than you might be able to in 
        some of the more delicate alternatives. Those are some of the ways to make 
        <a href="../index.html">espresso.</a></p>
