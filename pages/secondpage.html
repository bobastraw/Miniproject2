    <p>You install the porta-filter by twisting it into the machine, 
    and you place one small cup beneath each spout. You then turn 
    the valve to the espresso position. This engages the micro-switch
    that starts the pump, which pressurizes the heating chamber and 
    hot water to about 15 atmospheres (220 psi) of pressure. This forces
    the hot water through the ground coffee and out of the spouts. Ideally,
    it should take about 25 seconds for about 1.5 ounces of espresso to come out. Another method is the <a href="third.html">Moka Pot.</a> </p>
